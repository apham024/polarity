# polarity
Polarity is a text scanning application used for sentiment analysis for the 2016 Presidential Election.

## What it does
- The application first takes raw corpora of news transcripts from CNN, MSNBC, and FOX.
- Parses the raw corpora to remove punctuation, capitalization, headers, speaker names, etc. to create a clean version for the computer to understand.
- After the data has been stripped, the application then scans the document to look for positive and negative words, frequencies of words such as "Clinton" and "Trump" and their co-occurrences with positive and negative dimension words.
- A positivity score and network bias are generated based on those co-occurrences.

## What I hope to do
I hope to be able to add features like PoS Tagging and individual scores to each sentimental word to further my project and research.
