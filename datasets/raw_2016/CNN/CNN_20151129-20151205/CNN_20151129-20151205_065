BOB FURNAD, CNN FORMER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: When we found out at the local, the head of station a live cover, we jumped on it.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: Little Jessica McClure was playing hide and seek. Jessica tumbled down a pipe and landed in a small area about a foot wide. She was  trapped 20 feet underground.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: She`s upset and crying. For as long as she`s crying, we know that we have a chance.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: It has gone frustratingly slow.  
TONY CLARK, FORMER CNN DALLAS BUREAU CHIEF: When we got there, I started knocking on doors. And I would say, "I`m Tony Clark from CNN. We`re here to  cover the rescue attempt of Jessica McClure. I need your help. We`re trying to  shoot over the fence. Do you have a ladder that we could use?"    You knock on another door and say, "I hate to ask you this, but can I use your  phone?" That was the day before cell phones.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: Cameras and microphones have been dropped down. Jessica can be heard to call to her mother.   
CLARK: You could not widen the well that she was in. And you couldn`t come in at an angle.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: They drilled a shaft parallel to the one Jessica fell in.  
CLARK: So what you had to do is drill a parallel well that someone could get through.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: The rescuers are making progress literally by inches.  
CLARK: It was scary.  
UNIDENTIFED MALE: For the second night, floodlights have lit the backyard --  
CLARK: As the hours went on, you thought the chances of her surviving were less and less.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: A two-inch hole was drilled into the cavern where Jessica McClure has been trapped since Wednesday.   
CLARK: They had sent a medical worker down who was going to recover. You could see the lines tightening and so we knew it was going to happen. We`re expecting  to see Jessica just any moment now.       
UNIDENTIFED MALE: She`s alive, man.  
CLARK: I was very fortunate during all of my years in CNN to cover a lot of interesting stories.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: You could see the enthusiasm. You could hear the applause.  
CLARK: But this is one of those that is very special because it does have a happy ending.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: The applause for the paramedic who just -- who had brought her up.   
CLARK: People have worked very hard to come to a very happy ending.   I`m Tony Clark reporting live from Midland, Texas.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: Approaching Lockerbie about 7:00. And the whole sky lit off.  
UNIDENTIFED MALE: Our witnesses on the ground say they do not see how anyone could have survived.

UNIDENTIFED MALE: An explosive development near the Persian Gulf.  
GEORGE H.W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: There is no place that this sort of naked aggression in today`s world --   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: The failure of the Geneva talk seems to have convinced the Pentagon that war is imminent.   
FURNAD: I don`t think that the world really accepted CNN until the first Gulf War. The president had laid down the gauntlet and he basically gave us a window  of when it was going to happen. So, we had prepared everything for it. I recall  that during this time of preparation, I wake up from my sleep about 3:30 in the  morning.    I think that this is ridiculous, planning to cover the war on television. It`s  unheard of.   
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: It was very, very worrisome for all of us at CNN because we had producers in Baghdad, we had camera crews in Baghdad. We had  three reporters. Bernie Shaw was there, John Holliman, Peter Arnett -- they were  all there.    The management of CNN, Ted Turner and Tom Johnson, were under enormous pressure  from General Colin Powell, from other U.S. officials, probably from the press.  Get those guys out because once the air war starts, we don`t know if they`re  going to be OK.   
SHAW: But our responsibility is to our worldwide audience. We will stay. We will cover this war as best we can and we will report in the war.   
UNIDENTIFED MALE: Military experts say a night air attack is the likely scenario for the start of any fight.   
BLITZER: That night, I was at the Pentagon.   I had a chance to see two very senior Pentagon officials almost running through  the halls.    They couldn`t say when this was going to begin because that could endanger U.S.  troops.   
SHAW: It was shortly passed midnight, Baghdad time. And I was walking pass the open window, and coming down from the sky, the black sky, like silver paper. I  knew instantly what it was. It was chaff -- radar jamming chaff.   
GEORGE H.W. BUSH: Tonight, the battle has been joined.  
FURNAD: I was walking by the control room and I can hear the commotion. I walked in and there it was.   
BLITZER: Our team in Baghdad isn`t restricted. They weren`t going to get much information. The only thing they could do is report what they were seeing.   
CASPAR WEINBERGER, FMR. U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: But it doesn`t show any sign.  
UNIDENTIFED MALE: We have to go to Baghdad, Secretary. We`re going to Bernard Shaw in Baghdad.   
SHAW: This is a --   Out of my mouth came the words --    Something is happening outside.    The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. We`re seeing bright flashes going  off all over the sky.    The walls were shaking. The windows were vibrating, the concussions blowing us  against the wall.    The Iraqis shutdown CNN. They invoked censorship.    So, on Friday morning, we packed up and we started to leave Baghdad.    News, especially television news, is logistics, logistics, logistics. You can go  anywhere in the world to cover a new story.    Let`s describe to our viewers what we`re seeing.    But if you don`t have the capability of getting that story out, there`s no news.
